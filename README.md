# SSL-Messaging-Service
A simple messaging service application that allows a Server and Client to communitcate using the SSL (Secure Socket-Layer) connection. The program will run through the SSL Handshake and Record Layer Protocols, and once complete the Server and Client will be able to send encrypted messages to each other. Uses the RSA, DES and SHA-1 algorithms.

To run the program, run the Server code first and then the Client code. Both programs will run on localhost.
